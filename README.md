# INFO-5164-WebsiteAssignment
Repository for a college assignment

This is a Book Log, allowing tracking read books, rating them, and organizing by genre or author.

A live version of this project can be found at [https://kitcat962.github.io/INFO-5164-WebsiteAssignment/](https://kitcat962.github.io/INFO-5164-WebsiteAssignment/)

This project can be started locally by first installing all node modules `npm i`, then running `npm start`.

When building locally, ensure that the subdomain is setup correctly in `index.js`, `app.js`, and `package.json`.  
A ton of jank was done to get this working with github pages and my attempts to make it work dynamically failed.
